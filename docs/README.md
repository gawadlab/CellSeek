## Overview

Single Cell Explorer is a web application that allows interactive exploration from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets. It was designed to allow researchers to explore the developing murine cerebellum at single-cell resolution to generate hypotheses and identify gene-expression trends associated with cerebellar cell types throughout the development of the cerebellum from developmental day 10 (e10) through post-natal day 10 (p10)

## Usage

### Scattergrid plot

The scattergrid plot is the primary means to explore the dataset and is always visible. The scattergrid is a grid of fixed-size hexagons that occupies the plot area. A hexagon is rendered if it overlays a cell in the underlying scatterplot. Since the maximum number of hexagons is fixed, data can be quickly rendered and is limited primarily by network transfer speeds. Additionally, the scattergrid format allows interaction with the scattergrid plot itself, which leads to better interaction with the data.

Functionality is dependent on the selected tab left of the scattergrid plot. For example, zooming is enabled when the explore tab is selected, whereas group selection and the lasso is activated when the group tab is selected. See below for details.
